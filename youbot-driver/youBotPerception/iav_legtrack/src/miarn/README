This ``miarn'' code is a fork and library encapsulation from software
written by Joao Xavier. See

http://miarn.cjb.net/

AMBITION: Since the miarn code (IAV-based feature extraction and
         leg/person tracking) is so poorly documented, I here attempt
         to provide the "missing manual"... or at least, some usage
         notes and pointers.

*** Feature Types ***

MIARN_FEATURE_TYPE_ARC

(pos[0],pos[1]) - (x,y) coordinate of circle center
extra[0]        - circle radius
extra[1]        - mean (scaled by 1000?) inscribed angle of this segment 
extra[2]        - standard deviation (scaled by 1000?) of inscribed angle

--

MIARN_FEATURE_TYPE_LINE

(pos[0],pos[1]) - (x,y) coordinate of point on line that, with the origin,
                  forms normal vector.
extra[0]        - slope (scaled by 1000?)
extra[1]        - offset (call slope m and offset b; thus, the equation for
                  this line is y = m*x + b).
extra[2]        - maximum error of fitted line to a data point of this segment

--

MIARN_FEATURE_TYPE_PLEG

(pos[0],pos[1]) - (x,y) coordinate of midpoint of this segment

--

MIARN_FEATURE_TYPE_2LEGS

(pos[0],pos[1])     - (x,y) coordinate of midpoint of this segment
(extra[0],extra[1]) - (x,y) coordinate of rightmost leg (in particular,
                      point at 1/4 of this segment beginning at right)
(extra[2],extra[3]) - (x,y) coordinate of leftmost leg (in particular,
                      point at 3/4 of this segment beginning at right)

MIARN_FEATURE_TYPE_PERSON

*Note: See notes in Person structure in feature_person.hpp for details
      of precisely how previous, current and predicted person positions
      are determined.

(pos[0],pos[1])     - (x,y) coordinate of person
(extra[0],extra[1]) - predicted (x,y) coordinate of person
(extra[2],extra[3]) - previous (x,y) coordinate of person
(begin_x,begin_y)   - (x,y) coordinate of left leg (if it is attached;
                       otherwise, set to (0,0) ).
(end_x,end_y)       - (x,y) coordinate of right leg (if it is attached;
                       otherwise, set to (0,0) ).

MIARN_FEATURE_TYPE_LEG

*Note: See brief notes in leg structure in feature_person.hpp for
       details of how previous, current and predicted leg positions
       are determined.

(pos[0],pos[1])     - (x,y) coordinate of this leg
(extra[0],extra[1]) - predicted (x,y) coordinate of leg
(extra[2],extra[3]) - previous (x,y) coordinate of leg
